> [!WARNING]
> `pbir.tools` is in beta. Back up reports before large edits, especially bulk formatting, conversion, merge, and publish workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After installing `pbir`, run `pbir setup` to install agent skills, or install them from the [power-bi-agentic-development](https://github.com/data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development) marketplace. Without skills, your agent won't know how to use the CLI.

## Install

### PyPI (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install pbir-cli
```

Or with pip: `pip install pbir-cli`

<details>
<summary><strong>Native installers (macOS / Windows)</strong></summary>

Download the latest macOS or Windows installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/maxanatsko/pbir.tools/releases).

**macOS**

1. Download the installer from Releases and try to open it once.
2. If macOS blocks it because the installer is unsigned or not notarized, open:
   `System Settings` => `Privacy & Security`
3. Scroll down to the `Security` section. You should see a message about the blocked installer there.
4. Click `Open Anyway`.
5. When macOS asks again, click `Open` and finish the installation.

**Windows**

1. Download the installer from Releases and run it.
2. If Windows Defender SmartScreen shows `Windows protected your PC`, click `More info`.
3. Confirm the installer name, then click `Run anyway`.
4. Finish the installation.

</details>

After installation, open a new terminal and verify:

```bash
pbir --version
```

## Quick Start

```bash
pbir ls                                                                # List reports
pbir tree "Sales.Report" -v                                            # Full structure with fields
pbir model "Sales.Report" -d                                           # Model schema
pbir add visual card "Sales.Report/Overview.Page" --title "Revenue"    # Add a visual
pbir validate "Sales.Report"                                           # Health check
```

`pbir` works with PBIR-format reports stored as folders, using paths like:

```text
Report.Report/Page.Page/Visual.Visual
```

## Agents & Plugins

`pbir` is built for agents. To get the most out of it, install the **Power BI plugins** from the [power-bi-agentic-development](https://github.com/data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development) marketplace. These plugins provide skills, hooks, and agents that teach your agent how to work with Power BI reports, semantic models, themes, DAX, and more.

<details>
<summary><strong>Option 1: Install the marketplace directly</strong> (recommended)</summary>

Follow the instructions at [power-bi-agentic-development](https://github.com/data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development) to install the full marketplace plugin with all skills, agents, and hooks. After installing, run `/plugin` in your agent to enable auto-update and install plugins.

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI:**
```bash
copilot plugin install data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option 2: Install plugins via <code>pbir setup</code></strong></summary>

```bash
pbir setup
```

This auto-detects which agents you have installed (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Codex) and lets you pick which plugins to install interactively.

```bash
pbir setup --all                                # Install all plugins, all agents
pbir setup --agent claude-code --all            # Claude Code only, all plugins
pbir setup --plugin reports --plugin fabric-cli # Specific plugins
```

</details>

After installing, your agent will have access to skills for report creation, visual formatting, field binding, conditional formatting, theme management, filters, bookmarks, and more -- all driven by `pbir` commands under the hood.

## Documentation

## Safety

- **We recommend you take a manual backup (copy + paste) of your report folder before using `pbir` for the first time.**
- Run `pbir backup "Report.Report"` before larger edits.
- Run `pbir validate "Report.Report"` after every mutation.
- Use `-f` only when you intend bulk or destructive operations.
- Treat publish, convert, merge, and split commands as higher-risk workflows.

Always maintain independent backups of your reports before making changes, especially with bulk operations, format conversion, merge, and publish workflows.
